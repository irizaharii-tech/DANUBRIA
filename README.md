Danubria â€” Blue Waves final package
----------------------------------
- index.html (procedural realistic-ish truck built with Three.js primitives, no external GLB required)
- logo.png (converted to transparent if you uploaded one)
- .nojekyll and _config.yml included for GitHub Pages
Notes:
- If you later want a photorealistic GLB, upload /models/truck.glb into repo root; index.html will prefer it automatically.
- To deploy: upload all files to repo root (main branch) and enable GitHub Pages (root).
